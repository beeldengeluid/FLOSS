The Metadata Form Creation System (MFCS) is WVU Libraries answer for  providing an easy to use interface for librarians, staff, and students  for entering metadata and uploading digital items for our digital  collections. MFCS is also our archival and preservation system. MFCS is a delivery and repository agnostic system.

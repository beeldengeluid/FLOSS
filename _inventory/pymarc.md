Pymarc is a python library for working with bibliographic data encoded in MARC21. It should work under python 2.x and 3.x. It provides an API for reading, writing and modifying MARC records. It was mostly designed to be an emergency eject seat, for getting your data assets out of MARC and into some kind of saner representation.

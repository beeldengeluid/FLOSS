qualityofdocumentation: "Documentation on the concepts behind BIBFRAME are quite extensive, however documentation for developers seems to be limited by a not very descriptive README in GitHub."
easeofadaptation: "There is no plugin structure mentioned, but the tool’s functionalities (“convert MARC/XML Bibliographic records to BIBFRAME resources”) are fairly straightforward (there is an XQuery file for each format), so extending the tool for other types of bibliographic records should be not too hard."
codequality: "The most important bits of code are written in XQuery. Next to this there is an exhibit app in HTML. Both parts seem clear and are not hard to comprehend. However there is not much in the sense of comments."

developers: "January 2014: Lyrasis is now the organizational home of CollectionSpace. (The project was initiated and led by Museum of the Moving Image.

qualityofdocumentation: "The home page clearly provides a link to the documentation, which is very thorough and covers the most relevant topics such as: system requirements, how to configure & install it, how to use and maintain it and also how to develop customizations. The overall quality of this documentation is fairly good."
easeofadaptation: "CollectionSpace describes having a so-called hook system in place (which is used in e.g. Drupal or Wordpress), a design pattern to conveniently extend a system. Hook systems in general take some time to learn and in this case specific documentation on the hooks are yet to be added (some limited examples are available though)."
codequality: "The different parts, namely the UI, services, application, tools, etc, are in different sections in GitHub, making the distinction clear. Each of these sections is sparsely documented, however the code looks good with JavaDoc and maven pom.xml files."

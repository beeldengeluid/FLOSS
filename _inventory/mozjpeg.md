Modern JPEG encoder designed to reduce the size and load time of webpages that carry a lot of pictures. It has been announced in March 2014 and is today supported by big Websites like Facebook and used in tools like ImageOptim. Mozjpeg supports optimized Huffmann table, custom quanitization matrices and modern techniques like trellis quantization while maintaining the same values for the structured similarity index (SSIM).

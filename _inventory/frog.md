Frog formerly known as Tadpole is an integration of memory-based natural language processing (NLP) modules developed for Dutch. All NLP modules are based on Timbl the Tilburg memory-based learning software package. Most modules were created in the 1990s at the ILK Research Group (Tilburg University the Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp Belgium). Over the years they have been integrated into a single text processing tool. More recently a dependency parser a base phrase chunker and a named-entity recognizer module were added.

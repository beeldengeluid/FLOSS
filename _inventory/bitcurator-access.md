BitCurator Access software tools will assist collecting institutions 
(libraries, archives, and museums) in providing web-based and local 
access to born-digital materials held on disk images. BitCurator Access 
will focus on software that simplifies access to raw and 
forensically-packaged disk images, allowing collecting institutions to 
incorporate these objects into access environments in a manner that 
reflects the original order and relevant environmental context. The use 
of open source digital forensics software will allow for detailed 
analysis of file and file system provenance, quality and accessibility 
of files, metadata in files and the file system, and residual (non-file 
system) data contained within disk images.

qualityofdocumentation: "The home page quickly and clearly gives an introduction to Blacklight and shows all the necessary links, e.g. towards a quickstart guide and the GitHub, to get started as a developer. The overall documentation is available in a wiki and seems mostly well written and clear."
easeofadaptation: "There is a dedicated section on how to contribute to Blacklight as well as a page that lists the (un)official add-ons that are available. With several examples and clear instructions, as well as a developer mailing list,  it seems fairly straightforward to create custom extensions."
codequality: "The Ruby code contains useful comments. The main app is nicely structured according to MVC and includes YAML config files. The main JavaScript function clearly explains the structure and rationale of the code;  the aim is to use or extend JQuery plugins as much as possible. Overall the code seems to be of good quality."

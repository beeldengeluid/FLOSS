The BCT tool can be used to produce JPEG2000 or JPEG files of newspaper master images for presentation on the web. This tool calls two other tools, a binarization method from Basilis Gatos which is optimised for OCR, and Kakadu, a software development kit for creating JPEG2000 images. Therefore, in order to fully use the features of BCT, both tools must be installed and licensed. However, feel free to call your own tools from BCT.

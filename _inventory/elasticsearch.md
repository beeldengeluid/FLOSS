qualityofdocumentation: "Very user friendly website with extremely thorough documentation. Training, development support, and production support are all available. Github page with notes and directions. Blog is updated regularly and is up-to-date. There are also very interesting and helpful case studies available to see how groups have made use of ElasticSearch.
One downside of the documentation is that it’s sometimes hard to find concrete examples of every day use cases."
easeofadaptation: "ElasticSearch has many configuration options for building the search engine needed for your use case. Extending the tool itself is possible by contributing to GitHub, but isn’t probably something you would need to do."
codequality: "The (mainly Java) code seems well documented and commented."

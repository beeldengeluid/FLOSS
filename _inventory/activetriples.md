An ActiveModel-like interface for RDF data. Models graphs as 
Resources with property/attribute configuration, accessors, and other methods to support Linked Data in a Ruby/Rails enviornment.

This library was extracted from work on ActiveFedora. It is closely related to (and borrows some syntax from) Spira, but does some important things differently.

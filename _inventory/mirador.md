codequality: "The project started in August 2013. At the moment there are 4 contributors.  JavaScript is the language of choice. A “first-time-setup” https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon#first-time-setup is quite easy to do. Just install GRUNT (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) beforehand. On the command line, in the mirador folder type “grunt server” and open in your browser http://localhost:8000."

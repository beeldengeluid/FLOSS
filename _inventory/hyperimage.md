The HyperImage platform supports the linking of (audio)-visual objects, 
texts and mixed-media documents. HyperImage allows any number of 
details, or subregions, within an image to be highlighted and described,
 and for annotations within a corpus to be linked to each other, making 
them accessible in indices. Interim results as well as final versions 
can be compiled at any time as an online/offline hypermedia publication.
 This makes HyperImage a suitable research environment for digital 
humanities and eScience projects, providing a common research and 
publication environment for groups as well as individuals.

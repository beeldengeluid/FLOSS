Spotlight is a plugin for Blacklight, that enables libraries 
and other cultural heritage institutions to build online exhibits from 
content in their repositories to better highlight their digital 
collections. Â It extends Blacklight by providing a self-service, 
forms-based user interface that allows exhibit-builders, such as 
librarians or faculty, to customize the search interface and homepage, 
and to build media-rich feature pages to better contextualize their 
collections.

Grid is the Guardianâ€™s new image management system, which provides a universal and fast experience accessing media that is organised and using it in an affordable way to produce high-quality content. Grid runs as a set of independent micro-services (Scala and Play Framework) exposed as hypermedia APIs (argo) and accessed using a rich Web user interface (AngularJS). Grid relies on Elasticsearch for blazing-fast searching, and AWS services as additional storage and communication mechanisms.

qualityofdocumentation: "The main site briefly describes what the tool is and what dependencies the tool has. A prominent, but somehow easy to overlook, link to GitHub is available. On GitHub there is a short readme, which mainly points to an example index.html."
easeofadaptation: "The example HTML file includes quite a number of JavaScript functions that need to be examined in order to be able to understand how it all works. Besides this, the code is small and it shouldnâ€™t be too difficult to adapt the code to use different (geographical) input."
codequality: "There is not much code and it does look readable, but there are not many comments to help you. Because the code uses d3.js and uses geographical algorithms, it takes a while to get in to."

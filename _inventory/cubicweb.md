CubicWeb is a semantic web application
framework, licensed under the LGPL, that empowers developers to efficiently
build web applications by reusing components (called cubes)
and following the well known object-oriented design principles.
Its main features are:
an engine driven by the explicit data model
of the application,a query language named RQL similar to
W3Câ€™s SPARQL,a selection+view mechanism for
semi-automatic XHTML/XML/JSON/text generation,a library of reusable components
(data model and views) that fulfill common needs,the power and flexibility of the Python programming language,the reliability of SQL databases, LDAP directories, Subversion and
Mercurial for storage backends.

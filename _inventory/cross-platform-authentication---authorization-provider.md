Hybrid media devices, which can deliver audio, video and interactive  content over both broadcast and broadband, create new opportunities and 
challenges for broadcasters. Augmenting the broadcast experience with interactive content delivered over the Internet changes the classic  one-to-many paradigm bringing it closer to a one-to-one relationship.  
Cross-Platform Authentication (CPA) offers an open standard for associating any media device with an online identity, which facilitates delivery of personalized services to these devices.

In the LinkedTV project (http://linkedtv.eu), the Editor Tool (ET) enables moderating (named) entities and hyperlinks, which are automatically extracted from audiovisual content. This data is created to provide a useful starting point for editorial teams that are responsible for publishing interactive television programmes, which aim to offer contextual information to viewers.

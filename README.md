### Ace

ACE (Auditing Control Environment) is a system that incorporates anew methodology to address the integrity of long term archives using rigorous cryptographic techniques. ACE continuously audits the contents  of the various objects according to the policy set by the archive, and  provides mechanisms for an independent third-party auditor to certify the integrity of any object. ACE consists of two components, the first an Audit Manager(AM)  that checks files locally to ensure they have not been compromised. The  second part, the Integrity Management Service (IMS), issues tokens that  the AM can use to verify that its local store of file digests has not been tampered with.

### ASV Toolbox

ASV Toolbox is a modular collection of tools for the exploration of written language data. They work either on word lists or text and solve several linguistic classification and clustering tasks. The topics covered contain language detection, POS-tagging, base form reduction, named entity recognition, and terminology extraction. On a more abstract level, the algorithms deal with various kinds of word similarity, using pattern based and statistical approaches. The collection can be used to work on large real world data sets as well as for studying the underlying algorithms. The ASV Toolbox can work on plain text files and connect to a MySQL database. While it is especially designed to work with corpora of the Leipzig Corpora Collection, it can easily be adapted to other sources.

Activity types: Named entity recognition, POS Tagging, Extracting data

### BitCurator Access

BitCurator Access software tools will assist collecting institutions 
(libraries, archives, and museums) in providing web-based and local 
access to born-digital materials held on disk images. BitCurator Access 
will focus on software that simplifies access to raw and 
forensically-packaged disk images, allowing collecting institutions to 
incorporate these objects into access environments in a manner that 
reflects the original order and relevant environmental context. The use 
of open source digital forensics software will allow for detailed 
analysis of file and file system provenance, quality and accessibility 
of files, metadata in files and the file system, and residual (non-file 
system) data contained within disk images.

Development and MARC Standards Office

<http://bibframe.org/>   
<https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe>   

Categories: Metadata Checker/Validation, Metadata Mapping/Conversation/normalisation

* Quality of Documentation: Documentation on the concepts behind BIBFRAME are quite extensive, however documentation for developers seems to be limited by a not very descriptive README in GitHub.
* Ease of Adaptation: There is no plugin structure mentioned, but the tool’s functionalities (“convert MARC/XML Bibliographic records to BIBFRAME resources”) are fairly straightforward (there is an XQuery file for each format), so extending the tool for other types of bibliographic records should be not too hard.
* Code Quality: The most important bits of code are written in XQuery. Next to this there is an exhibit app in HTML. Both parts seem clear and are not hard to comprehend. However there is not much in the sense of comments.
* Examples: http://bibframe.org/demos/

The overall documentation is available in a wiki and seems mostly well written and clear.
* Ease of Adaptation: There is a dedicated section on how to contribute to Blacklight as well as a page that lists the (un)official add-ons that are available. With several examples and clear instructions, as well as a developer mailing list,  it seems fairly straightforward to create custom extensions.
* Code Quality: The Ruby code contains useful comments. The main app is nicely structured according to MVC and includes YAML config files. The main JavaScript function clearly explains the structure and rationale of the code;  the aim is to use or extend JQuery plugins as much as possible. Overall the code seems to be of good quality.

Categories: Collection Management

* Quality of Documentation: The home page clearly provides a link to the documentation, which is very thorough and covers the most relevant topics such as: system requirements, how to configure & install it, how to use and maintain it and also how to develop customizations. The overall quality of this documentation is fairly good.
* Ease of Adaptation: CollectionSpace describes having a so-called hook system in place (which is used in e.g. Drupal or Wordpress), a design pattern to conveniently extend a system. Hook systems in general take some time to learn and in this case specific documentation on the hooks are yet to be added (some limited examples are available though).
* Code Quality: The different parts, namely the UI, services, application, tools, etc, are in different sections in GitHub, making the distinction clear. Each of these sections is sparsely documented, however the code looks good with JavaDoc and maven pom.xml files.

### Cross-Platform Authentication - Authorization Provider

Hybrid media devices, which can deliver audio, video and interactive  content over both broadcast and broadband, create new opportunities and 
challenges for broadcasters. Augmenting the broadcast experience with interactive content delivered over the Internet changes the classic  one-to-many paradigm bringing it closer to a one-to-one relationship.  
Cross-Platform Authentication (CPA) offers an open standard for associating any media device with an online identity, which facilitates delivery of personalized services to these devices.

<https://github.com/shawnbot/d3-cartogram/>   

Categories: Geo-spatial Apllications, Data Visulaisation

* Quality of Documentation: The main site briefly describes what the tool is and what dependencies the tool has. A prominent, but somehow easy to overlook, link to GitHub is available. On GitHub there is a short readme, which mainly points to an example index.html.
* Ease of Adaptation: The example HTML file includes quite a number of JavaScript functions that need to be examined in order to be able to understand how it all works. Besides this, the code is small and it shouldn’t be too difficult to adapt the code to use different (geographical) input.
* Code Quality: There is not much code and it does look readable, but there are not many comments to help you. Because the code uses d3.js and uses geographical algorithms, it takes a while to get in to.

### digilib

Digilib is a web based client/server technology for images. The image content is processed on-the-fly by a Java Servlet on the server side so that only the visible portion of the image is sent to the web browser on the client side. It supports a wide range of image formats and viewing options on the server side while only requiring an internet browser with javascript and a low bandwidth internet connection on the client side. digilib enables very detailed work on an image as required by scientists with elaborate zoom features like an option to show images on the screen in their original size. digilib facilitates cooperation of scientists over the internet and novel uses of source material by image annotations and stable references that can be embedded in URLs. digilib is used in the ALCATRAZ framework of image, text and annotation tools and many other projects. - See more at: http://dirtdirectory.org/resources/digilib#sthash.60AWtXSq.CDwoNbFA.dpuf

### File Analyzer and Metadata Harvester

This application functions like a digitization Swiss army knife.  The application allows a user to analyze the contents of a file system or external drive and generates statistics about the contents of the contained directories.  The application can be used to generate checksum values to ensure the bit-level integrity of files after they have been copied to a new device.  After a collection of files have been converted from one digital format to another, this application can verify that there is a one-to-one match of before and after files.

### File Rename Tool (FRT)

The File Rename Tool (FRT):
 Deliveries dates are obviously available on newspapers so that they have the
possibility to be saerched for by data later on. If a newspaper is not available 
in day folders, the ‘File Renaming Tool’ can help to bring them into the
 right structure and support libraries in renaming and reordering their 
images according to the Europeana Newspapers project specifications.
 The main idea of FRT is that images, which may be stored on year level,
 can be quickly ordered on the basis of issues and publishing date.

### Franken +

The Initiative for Digital Humanities Media and Culture (IDHMC) at Texas A&M University as part of its Early Modern OCR Project (eMOP) has created a new tool called Franken+ that provides a way to create font training for the Tesseract OCR engine using page images. This is in contrast to Tesseract's document method of font training which involves using a word processing program with a modern font. ''''Franken+ works in conjunction with PRImA's Aletheia tool and allows users to easily and quickly identify one or more idealized forms of each glyph found on a set of page images. These identified forms are then used to generate a set of Franken-page images matching the page characteristics documented in Tesseract's training instructions but using a font used in an actual early modern printed document.

### Frog

Frog formerly known as Tadpole is an integration of memory-based natural language processing (NLP) modules developed for Dutch. All NLP modules are based on Timbl the Tilburg memory-based learning software package. Most modules were created in the 1990s at the ILK Research Group (Tilburg University the Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp Belgium). Over the years they have been integrated into a single text processing tool. More recently a dependency parser a base phrase chunker and a named-entity recognizer module were added.

### ImageMontage


ImageMontage creates montages of images without the need to load them 
into a stack first. The source images can be located in one or multiple 
directories. The images can also have different sizes. To fit images 
into a montage, the macro scales them vertically to the same 
user-specified size. Images are added horizontally until they no longer 
fit on the row and then a new row is started. This process is repeated 
until all source images are rendered. If you see that the generated 
montage does not include all source images, change the options to reduce
 the size of images and/or increase canvas dimensions, and run the macro
 again.

### LoCloud_bglink

Background link service for LoCloud

This repository contains the background link service module developed
within the LoCloud project. The module consists of a PHP script that
implements a REST service, calls DBpedia
Spotlight
for the actual processing, and wraps the answer into a suitable
format.

The background link service uses DBpedia Spotlight as a backbone for
performing the linking. In principle, the service can be used in any
language, the only requirement being that a DBpedia spotlight instance for
this particular language is running.

### MediaWiki

MediaWiki is free server-based software which is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It's designed to be run on a large server farm for a website that gets millions of hits per day.
MediaWiki is an extremely powerful, scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation that uses PHP to process and display data stored in a database, such as MySQL.
Pages use MediaWiki's wikitext format, so that users without knowledge of XHTML or CSS can edit them easily.
When a user submits an edit to a page, MediaWiki writes it to the 
database, but without deleting the previous versions of the page, thus 
allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming. MediaWiki can 
manage image and multimedia files, too, which are stored in the 
filesystem. For large wikis with lots of users, MediaWiki supports 
caching and can be easily coupled with Squid proxy server software.

### Stanford Natural Language Processing Group (NLP)

 Stanford CoreNLP provides a set of natural language analysis tools which can take raw English language text input and give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc., normalize dates, times, and numeric quantities, and mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and word dependencies, and indicate which noun phrases refer to the same entities, etc. Stanford CoreNLP is an integrated framework, which make it very easy to apply a bunch of language analysis tools to a piece of text. Starting from plain text, you can run all the tools on it with just two lines of code. Its analyses provide the foundational building blocks for higher-level and domain-specific text understanding applications.

* Quality of Documentation: The documentation describes the three steps needed in order to get the application to work and produce the desired results for the user. This information can be found on the custom website of the project. All information related to programmers’ views can be found on the GitHub page of the project. Information exists there for the programmers to install and configure the tool based on their needs, but the related text could be of higher quality.
* Ease of Adaptation: As this is a software used for one specific operation the ease of adaptation depends on the need that the operation tends to cover. In our case, TimeMapper’s ease of adaptation is bound by the support of JS and availability of a Google account, for the side of the user, and the will to use JS, for the side of the programmer. There is no documentation for adapting/extending the tool. 
* Code Quality: Very well written documentation for users.  Also very well written documentation for programmers (found on the Github page). Frequent documentation updates and live demo.

* Quality of Documentation: No custom website for the tool. The docs on Github contain all the necessary information for the tool’s operation. Since this is not a software but (could be considered to be) large scale script performing a specific funtion, the lack of a custom website cannot be considered as a substantial drawback in the project’s ebaluation, as long as all the necessary information is exists.The tutorials for users and programmers are very well written and descriptive.
* Ease of Adaptation: The ease of adaptation needed for this tool’s specific funtionality is a part of its operation. Namely that would be the index rules setting, for which the information given over the documentation is quite extensive. 
* Code Quality: The package structure for the tool is clear and there are numerous tests for users and programmers to look upon. The number of contibutors is small but the support and updates frequency is adequate for a tool of that size. The tool is written in JRuby.

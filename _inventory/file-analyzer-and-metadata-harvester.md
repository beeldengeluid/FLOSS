This application functions like a digitization Swiss army knife.  The application allows a user to analyze the contents of a file system or external drive and generates statistics about the contents of the contained directories.  The application can be used to generate checksum values to ensure the bit-level integrity of files after they have been copied to a new device.  After a collection of files have been converted from one digital format to another, this application can verify that there is a one-to-one match of before and after files.

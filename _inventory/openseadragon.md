A “first-time-setup” https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon#first-time-setup is quite easy to do. Just install GRUNT (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) beforehand. On the command line, in the openseadragon folder type “grunt connect watch” and open in your browser http://localhost:8000/test/demo/basic.html."

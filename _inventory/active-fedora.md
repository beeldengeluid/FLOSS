Rubydora and ActiveFedora provide a set of Ruby gems for creating and
managing objects in the Fedora Repository Architecture
(http://fedora-commons.org). ActiveFedora
is loosely based on “ActiveRecord” in Rails. The 3.x series of
ActiveFedora depends on Rails 3, specifically activemodel and
activesupport.

qualityofdocumentation: "No custom website for the tool. The docs on Github contain all the necessary information for the tool’s operation. Since this is not a software but (could be considered to be) large scale script performing a specific funtion, the lack of a custom website cannot be considered as a substantial drawback in the project’s ebaluation, as long as all the necessary information is exists.The tutorials for users and programmers are very well written and descriptive."
easeofadaptation: "The ease of adaptation needed for this tool’s specific funtionality is a part of its operation. Namely that would be the index rules setting, for which the information given over the documentation is quite extensive."
codequality: "The package structure for the tool is clear and there are numerous tests for users and programmers to look upon. The number of contibutors is small but the support and updates frequency is adequate for a tool of that size. The tool is written in JRuby."

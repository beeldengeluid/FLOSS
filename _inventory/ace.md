ACE (Auditing Control Environment) is a system that incorporates anew methodology to address the integrity of long term archives using rigorous cryptographic techniques. ACE continuously audits the contents  of the various objects according to the policy set by the archive, and  provides mechanisms for an independent third-party auditor to certify the integrity of any object. ACE consists of two components, the first an Audit Manager(AM)  that checks files locally to ensure they have not been compromised. The  second part, the Integrity Management Service (IMS), issues tokens that  the AM can use to verify that its local store of file digests has not been tampered with.

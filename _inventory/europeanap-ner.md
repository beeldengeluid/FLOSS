This tool takes container documents (MPEG21-DIDL, METS), parses all references to ALTO files and tries to find named entities in the pages (with most models: Location, Person, Organisation, Misc). The aim is to keep the physical location on the page available through the whole process to be able to highlight the results in a viewer.

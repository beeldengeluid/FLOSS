Instructions also available within the code repository. Easy to access, read, and follow."
easeofadaptation: "The GitHub explains having a plugin structure for converting different datasources (to LOD), so creating a plugin for custom content sources should be fairly straightforward. Moreover, the codebase is small an clear, so further adapting the tool should not be too difficult."
codequality: "The Slim PHP micro framework is used, making the code and all configurations not hard to grasp. The code itself contains several useful comments."

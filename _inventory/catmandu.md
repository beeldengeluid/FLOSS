qualityofdocumentation: "The main site offers a brief introduction of the capabilities of Catmandu and offers an extensive tutorial. The GitHub code repository also contains developer documentation, but needs to be generated (or you can find it by browsing the code repository) after downloading. The developer documentation seems well written and quite extensive."
easeofadaptation: "The code repository in GitHub also includes a page directed to contributers, but does not seem to desribe any plugin architecture. Since the code seems professionally maintained and fairly well documented, adding customizations to the code seems worth considering."
codequality: "The Perl code looks well structured, well written, and contains comments in the form of perldoc. There is a long list of tests available. Also the code is included in CPAN (a repository of Perl libraries)."

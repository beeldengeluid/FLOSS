Spira is a framework for using the information in RDF.rb repositories as model
objects.  It gives you the ability to work in a resource-oriented way without
losing access to statement-oriented nature of linked data, if you so choose.
It can be used either to access existing RDF data in a resource-oriented way,
or to create a new store of RDF data based on simple defaults.

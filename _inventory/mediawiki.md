MediaWiki is free server-based software which is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It's designed to be run on a large server farm for a website that gets millions of hits per day.
MediaWiki is an extremely powerful, scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation that uses PHP to process and display data stored in a database, such as MySQL.
Pages use MediaWiki's wikitext format, so that users without knowledge of XHTML or CSS can edit them easily.
When a user submits an edit to a page, MediaWiki writes it to the 
database, but without deleting the previous versions of the page, thus 
allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming. MediaWiki can 
manage image and multimedia files, too, which are stored in the 
filesystem. For large wikis with lots of users, MediaWiki supports 
caching and can be easily coupled with Squid proxy server software.

Nodel is an open source digital media control system built on Java and Python.

It uses a series of nodes that perform "actions" or respond to 
"signals" to control various devices on a network, allowing quick and 
easy management of digital media devices.

Nodel is typically used to control digital media in galleries, museums, corporate meeting rooms and digital signage.

In short, Nodel can manage any programmable device across a wide range of platforms.

Music21 is a set of tools for helping 
scholars and other active listeners answer questions about music quickly
 and simply.  If you’ve ever asked yourself a question like, “I wonder 
how often Bach does that” or “I wish I knew which band was the 
first to use these chords in this order,” or “I’ll bet we’d know more 
about Renaissance counterpoint (or Indian ragas or post-tonal pitch structures or the form of minuets) if I could write a program to automatically write more of them,” then music21 can help you with your work.

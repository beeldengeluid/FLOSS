qualityofdocumentation: "The documentation describes the three steps needed in order to get the application to work and produce the desired results for the user. This information can be found on the custom website of the project. All information related to programmers’ views can be found on the GitHub page of the project. Information exists there for the programmers to install and configure the tool based on their needs, but the related text could be of higher quality."
easeofadaptation: "As this is a software used for one specific operation the ease of adaptation depends on the need that the operation tends to cover. In our case, TimeMapper’s ease of adaptation is bound by the support of JS and availability of a Google account, for the side of the user, and the will to use JS, for the side of the programmer. There is no documentation for adapting/extending the tool."
codequality: "Very well written documentation for users.  Also very well written documentation for programmers (found on the Github page). Frequent documentation updates and live demo."

The Initiative for Digital Humanities Media and Culture (IDHMC) at Texas A&M University as part of its Early Modern OCR Project (eMOP) has created a new tool called Franken+ that provides a way to create font training for the Tesseract OCR engine using page images. This is in contrast to Tesseract's document method of font training which involves using a word processing program with a modern font. ''''Franken+ works in conjunction with PRImA's Aletheia tool and allows users to easily and quickly identify one or more idealized forms of each glyph found on a set of page images. These identified forms are then used to generate a set of Franken-page images matching the page characteristics documented in Tesseract's training instructions but using a font used in an actual early modern printed document.

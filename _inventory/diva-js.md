Diva.js (Document Image Viewer with AJAX) is a 
Javascript frontend for viewing documents, designed to work with digital
 libraries to present multi-page documents as a single, continuous item.
Only the pages that are being viewed at any given time are actually 
present in the document, with the rest appended as necessary, ensuring 
efficient memory usage and high loading speeds. Written as a jQuery plugin, diva.js requires the jQuery Javascript library. Diva's back end is constituted by the IIPImage server.

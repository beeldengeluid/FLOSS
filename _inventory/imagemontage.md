ImageMontage creates montages of images without the need to load them 
into a stack first. The source images can be located in one or multiple 
directories. The images can also have different sizes. To fit images 
into a montage, the macro scales them vertically to the same 
user-specified size. Images are added horizontally until they no longer 
fit on the row and then a new row is started. This process is repeated 
until all source images are rendered. If you see that the generated 
montage does not include all source images, change the options to reduce
 the size of images and/or increase canvas dimensions, and run the macro
 again.

The File Rename Tool (FRT):
 Deliveries dates are obviously available on newspapers so that they have the
possibility to be saerched for by data later on. If a newspaper is not available 
in day folders, the ‘File Renaming Tool’ can help to bring them into the
 right structure and support libraries in renaming and reordering their 
images according to the Europeana Newspapers project specifications.
 The main idea of FRT is that images, which may be stored on year level,
 can be quickly ordered on the basis of issues and publishing date.

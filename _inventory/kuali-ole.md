Kuali OLE is the first system designed by and for academic and research libraries for managing and delivering intellectual information. A community of partners will deliver an enterprise-ready, 
community-source software package to manage and provide access not only 
to items in their collections but also to licensed and local digital 
content. Kuali OLE (pronounced oh-LAY, for Open Library Environment) 
features a governance model in which the entire library community can 
collaborate to own the resulting intellectual property.

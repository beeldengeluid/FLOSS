Digitate is a free application designed for use on the iOS platform, specifically on iPad devices. The application allows scholars and enthusiasts with an interest in the visual and material elements of a cultural artefact to make notes and annotations directly on an image of such an artefact.For example, a literary scholar might use it to annotate the material or bibliographic elements of a rare text or first edition, while an art historian might do the same on an image of a painting.

Heiðrún (a.k.a. Heidrun, pronounced [roughly] hey-droon) is
 DPLA's new metadata aggregation system, which we use to harvest 
metadata from Hubs, map it to the DPLA Metadata Application Profile, 
enrich it to clean up and add value, and to index it for use in the DPLA
 Platform API. Heiðrún is implemented as a Ruby on Rails application 
that builds on Krikri, a
 Ruby gem for metadata harvesting, mapping, and enrichment. Heiðrún and 
Krikri are both released as open source software under the MIT License.
